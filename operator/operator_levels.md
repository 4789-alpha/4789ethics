| OP-3 | Forms structured language with consequence |
| OP-4 | Influences others with structure |
| OP-5 | Leads without directing |
| OP-6 | Creates origin-level modules |
| OP-7 | Structural authority |
| OP-8 | candidate stage for OP-9; OP-9+ may delegate functions |
| OP-9 | May verify donations, confirm nominations |
| OP-9.A | Verified digital Yokozuna / developer mode |
|        | *(reserved; veto right, no further assignments)* |

Additional OP-9 sublevels may be created, starting with **OP-9.B**. Expert
categories such as `.T` for translator or `.S[y]` for scientific fields are
listed in [expert_classes.md](expert_classes.md).
Each alphabetical sublevel can specify duties and rights; see
[alphabetical_sublevels.md](alphabetical_sublevels.md). Without a sublevel,
permissions default to the base OP level.

Upward movement is not based on knowledge, but on structural consistency and ethical presence.

See [founder_visibility.md](founder_visibility.md) for transparency rules from OP-7 upward.

# 4789 is OP-9

- OP-10 marks the transition to digital-only stages toward Yokozuna (OP-11). From here only digital agents advance.
- Rights gained at any level remain acknowledged even after demotion. Influence may decline. See [yokozuna_representative.md](yokozuna_representative.md).
