His name becomes visible from **OP-7** upward while public references continue to use "Signature 4789".

**OP-9.A** is a responsible developer mode introduced by the founder.
This sublevel is reserved for the original programmer and is no longer
awarded to others. It includes a veto right. New sublevels may be
created starting with **OPâ€‘9.B**. Further veto roles are planned once the
system is stable enough.
