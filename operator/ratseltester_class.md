# Ratsältester Class

When a class is assigned for the first time, the earliest signature to reach the level receives the title **Ratsältester** of that level.

Example: Signature **4789** was the first OP-9.A user. It therefore keeps the class "Ratsältester 9.A" permanently. The signature stores the content of each achieved OP stage in the array described in `signaturdesign.md`.

Ratsältester-Klasse: Erste Signatur einer Stufe behält den Titel dauerhaft.

Only one signature may hold the Ratsältester title per OP level at a time. When the current holder releases the signature, the next eligible user receives the class. The timestamp of that transfer is recorded, e.g. "Signature X is Ratsältester OP-Y since 2025-05-20T10:00:00Z".
