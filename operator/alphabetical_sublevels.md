# Alphabetical Sublevels

Operator levels can include alphabetical subdivisions (e.g., OP-9.B, OP-9.C) for
specialized tasks. Only **OP-9.A** is explicitly defined and reserved for the
original developer with a veto right. New letters may describe further duties as
the structure grows.

- **OP-7.O** – may control mechatronic components when the gatekeeper and
  ethics module confirm responsible use.

If a signature exists but no sublevel is specified, permissions fall back to the
base level—new registrations default to **OP-1**.
