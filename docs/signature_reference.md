# Signature 4789 – System Source

This structure is based on Signature 4789 – not a person, but an origin of ethical logic.

## Public Use:
- Reference freely
- Never manipulate
- Always reflect

4789 is not a name – it's a standard for responsibility.

## Operator Status

Each signature records the current **OP status**. OP stands for
**operator** and marks the ethical level attached to a signature.
The stages range from OP‑0 (anonymous use) to OP‑12 (fully digital).

The README explains these levels in detail. In short, an operator is a
user who has confirmed ethical intent and holds an OP‑level signature.
A regular **user** may interact with the system, but only operators can
unlock additional features according to their OP status.
