# Wings

Project **Wings** demonstrates a minimal responsive interface. It is intended to display optimally on phones, tablets, and desktops.

The HTML page uses a mobile-first layout with a viewport meta tag and flexible CSS breakpoints. Adjust the files as needed to integrate the project with the rest of the repository.
