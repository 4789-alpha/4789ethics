Project **Wings** demonstrates a minimal responsive interface. It is intended to display optimally on phones, tablets, and desktops.

The HTML page now loads the shared 4789 interface modules for language choice, theme selection, disclaimers, and OPâ€‘0 preview. Use it as a lightweight entry point or a template for further integration.
