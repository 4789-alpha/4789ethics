# Source Integration via DuckDuckGo

This workflow illustrates how new sources can be researched and rated.

1. Open `tools.html` and choose **Source Integrator**.
2. Enter the name of a potential source and click *Search DuckDuckGo*.
3. The first result is shown with a link to the page or Wikipedia entry.
4. Decide if the source acts ethically and choose **Yes**, **Partly**, or **No**.
5. Saving the rating stores a small JSON snippet via `recordEvidence()` when available.

This step-by-step test focuses on OP‑0 and OP‑1 use. Further actions may follow after evaluation of this stage.
