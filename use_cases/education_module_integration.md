# Education Module Integration

Teachers at OP-6 can create new subject modules such as language or math. Start from `interface/` templates and adjust the content for each lesson.

1. Duplicate an existing HTML/JS pair, e.g. `fischeBern.html` and `fischeBern.js`.
2. Adjust titles and data paths to your subject.
3. Include the module in the navigation once reviewed.

The fish editor demonstrates OP-5 access control with confirmed responsibility (`sana_confirmed`).
