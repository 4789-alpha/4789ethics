# Fish Interface

This folder holds the regional interfaces and data sources for ethical fish awareness.
The starting region is Bern, but additional regions can be added under this folder
by supplying new HTML/JS files and corresponding JSON sources in `sources/fish`.

The goal is to promote respectful and transparent handling of fish populations
worldwide. Contributions should follow the 4789 principles and the
Open-Ethics License.
