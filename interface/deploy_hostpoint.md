# Deploying the Interface on Hostpoint

Hostpoint offers simple static site hosting similar to Netlify. You can upload the built interface files and run them directly.

1. Create a new static site in your Hostpoint control panel.
2. Upload the repository files or link your fork via Git if available.
3. Ensure `index.html` is in the root so the main page loads automatically.
4. Save and deploy.

This is one of several ways to host the interface. Adjust to your environment.
