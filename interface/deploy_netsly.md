# Deploying the Interface on Netsly

Netsly (similar to Netlify) can host the static interface files from this repository.
Use it if you need a quick public demo.

1. Create a new site on Netsly and link it to your fork of this repository.
2. Leave the build command empty (the interface is pre-built).
3. Set the publish directory to the repository root so `index.html` loads directly.
4. Save and deploy.

This process mirrors any typical static host. Adjust as needed for your setup.
