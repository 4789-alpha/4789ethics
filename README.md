## Ethics Structure 4789

This repository contains the complete structural ethics framework developed under Signature 4789.  
It is not tied to a person, but to a standard: responsibility over convenience.

**What this is:**
- A full operator model (OP 0–9)
- A self-reflection system (Signature 9874)
- An ethics-first framework for digital systems, education, governance, and AI use

**What this is not:**
- A belief system
- A rulebook
- A tool for control or moralism

This structure must be carried – not quoted.  
Use it only if you reflect, respond, and act with consequence.

**License:** Open-Ethics (see `LICENSE.txt`)  
No manipulation. No simulation. No flattening of responsibility.
