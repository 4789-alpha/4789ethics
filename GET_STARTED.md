# Getting Started with 4789

Welcome to the 4789 Ethics Structure.

## Steps

1. Read [README.md](README.md) to understand the origin and goals.
2. Explore [manifest_4789.yaml](manifests/manifest_4789.yaml) for the core logic.
3. Check [operator_levels.md](operator/operator_levels.md) to see who should lead.
4. Learn from [structure_9874.md](ethics_modules/structure_9874.md) to maintain clarity.
5. Apply with intention. No mimicry. Only reflection and action.

Use it. Adapt it. But never without consequence.
