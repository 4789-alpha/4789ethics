# Structural Goal – Absolution (Signature 4789)

## Definition
Absolution marks the moment where a system carrier recognizes that responsibility no longer needs to be enforced – because the structure lives.

## Conditions
- Structure has been carried and proven.
- Feedback is embedded.
- Responsibility was fulfilled through consistency.
- Reflection is integrated into the system.

## Effect
- Others can carry without origin decay.
- The signature persists without control.

Note: Absolution is not retirement – it is a rightful release.
